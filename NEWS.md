# Major changes from 0.1.0 to 0.2.0

* Added experimental support for running containers using Docker,
  rather than Bubblewrap.

* Added initial support for generating SBOMs for each package.
  These SBOMs will be used with other composition tools to generate
  so-called multi-layer SBOMs.

* Added support for breakpoint labels in pipelines.  These allow
  a build to be suspended or resumed from a specific point in the
  pipeline.  Care must be used to ensure the build environment
  locations are supplied when resuming a build, or a new build
  environment will be created.

* Added support for source cache directories.  This includes fetching
  sources from Google Cloud Storage buckets instead of their URIs.
  The melange `update-cache` command can be used to manage source cache
  directories, including remote GCS buckets.

* Added support for conditionals in build pipelines.  These allow
  specific pipeline elements to be skipped if a conditional is false:

```yaml
pipeline:
  - if: ${{foo}} == ${{bar}}
    runs: |
      echo "foo equals bar"
  - if: ${{foo}} != ${{bar}}
    runs: |
      echo "foo does not equal bar"
```

* Added support for sub-pipeline assertion guards.  These allow a user to
  specify that at least N steps in the sub-pipeline ran successfully in
  order for the sub-pipeline itself to pass.  In this example, the
  sub-pipeline would pass for x86_64 and aarch64, but fail for s390x,
  as there has not been a branch defined in the pipeline that would run
  on s390x:

```yaml
pipeline:
  - assertions:
      required-steps: 1
    pipeline:
      - if: ${{build.arch}} == 'x86_64'
        uses: fetch
        with:
          uri: https://example.com/binaries-x86_64.tar.gz
          expected-sha256: 8f754fdd5af783fe9020978c64e414cb45f3ad0a6f44d045219bbf2210ca3cb9
      - if: ${{build.arch}} == 'aarch64'
        uses: fetch
        with:
          uri: https://example.com/binaries-arm64.tar.gz
          expected-sha256: f406136010e6a1cdce3fb6573506f00d23858af49dd20a46723c3fa5257b7796
```

* Builtin pipeline data is now embedded into the Melange binary itself.

* Added support for meta-programming with `data` and `range` specifiers.
  At the moment, this only applies to subpackages, but could be expanded to
  pipeline elements in the future:

```yaml
data:
  - name: lagomorphs
    items:
      hare: 'lepus saxatilis'
      rabbit: 'sylv√¨lagus floridanus'
      pika: 'ochotona princeps'

subpackages:
  - range: lagomorphs
    name: "lagomorph-${{range.key}}"
    description: "data about the lagomorph ${{range.value}}"
    pipeline:
      [...]
```

* Added experimental support for renovating Melange YAML manifests.  This
  includes the `melange bump` command which can be used to update the version
  of a package in a manifest.

# Changes for Melange 0.1.0

* Initial release.
